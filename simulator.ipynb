A qubit in state |0> is represented by the vector [1, 0]. This representation signifies that when the first qubit is measured, there is a probability of $1$ that the qubit will be measured in the state |0>. Likewise, a qubit in state |1> is represented by the vector [0, 1], and has a probability of $1$ of being measured in the state |1>.\n",
